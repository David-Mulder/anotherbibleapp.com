        <div class="card-content">
          If you ask a question you should write it in such a way that it's not only useful for you if it gets an answer,
          but also for everybody else who might ever wonder about this issue. For this reason this site works a bit
          differently from most forums across the internet and has a couple of rules to keep in mind:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Do not include salutations</strong> ('Hi', 'Greetings', etc.), <strong>thanks</strong>
              ('Thanks!', 'Thanks in advance', etc.) <strong>or your signature</strong> in the question body. Your name is already right
              next to the question and this keeps the question to the point.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every question should be worded in such a way that there could be <strong>one definite answer</strong>.
              Try to write them in such a way that they do not incite discussion, although it's fine that different answers will disagree.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every question should <strong>only contain one actual question</strong>. Do not combine multiple question in to one
              except if the overlap is huge. In most cases splitting them up is better.
            </li>
            <li>
              Others may edit your posts to improve them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </paper-card>
      <paper-card heading="Question categories">
        <div class="card-content">
          To keep questions focused they are split in to three categories:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Questions regarding the events described in the text. This applies primarily to texts that describe
              historical events and questions will often be about the temporal context.
            </li>
            <li>
              Questions regarding the author, his intentions and his public. Why was the text written as it was written?
              How was it understood by it's audience? Why did the author decide to write the text in the first place?
            </li>
            <li>
              Questions regarding the modern application the text has for the modern reader. These questions will often
              incite most discussion, so please read the rules carefully above and write these questions well. In the
              future once this site has ran for awhile good questions will hopefully show up and I will improve
              the description here.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <paper-card heading="Formatting">
        <div class="card-content">
          This site uses Markdown to handle it's formatting with a couple additions, here are the most important things to know:
          <ul>
            <li>
              To start a new paragraph just leave an empty line in between.
            <code><!--
              -->First paragraph.

<!--              -->Second paragraph.<!--
            --></code>
            </li>
            <li>
              To quote someone put it on an a standalone line with a &gt; in front.
<code>Augustine claimed that:

> And here you place your quote
> even if it spans multiple lines.

and you continue like normal again.</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) To link a Bible verse use `[Mt 3:3]` for example, to quote a bible passage use the quotation syntax from above
              with just
              <code>> Mt 3:3-4</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          For full instructions (making text bold, italic, underline, a header, etc.) just Google for 'markdown'.
