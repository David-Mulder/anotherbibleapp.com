            Whilst studying the history of the Church I noticed a certain trend. Back before the reformation the books
            of the bible were explained to the people by the Church rather than people making their own interpretations.
            Now, protestants will typically consider this a bad thing - with a lot of very good reasons - , however it did
            mean that the books of the Bible were studied by those would had been relatively well educated and had likely
            had a proper theological schooling. Next during the reformation this shifted to bible reading and studying in groups, where the Bible became something that was accessible for everyone. And fast forwarding to now this has shifted more and more to an individualistic and often theologically uneducated approach to bible study.
          </p>

            Now, a common, traditional way to react at this point is to argue that God will simply speak through the
            Bible through the Holy Spirit and ensure that the Bible is understood correctly. Personally I believe that the history of the Church with all it's denominations teach us that it's not that simple. I have been in the position where I
            was leading Bible study groups where some of the less 'intellectually endowed' came up with some outright
            terrible interpretations. Now, I have never made fun of those people, but the reason I am sharing this is that
            I do believe the Bible teaches us that we are one body and that we should complete and help each other. So
            the goal of this project is to create a platform where does who have studied matters of theology are able to
            share in a free and open way their knowledge with those who have or can not. Put differently what I am trying
            to achieve is moving away from the modern individualistic Bible reading to a more collaborative studying.

            Now, I hold no illusions that people will now suddenly magically come to agree with each other, and for that
            reason I decided to not design this platform as a Wikipedia-clone. Instead a Q&A approach was followed
            where differing answers can live side by side.
