              This application has been built as a private project in free time. This means paying professional lawyers to write a proper privacy policy and terms of use isn't an option. The result of this is that I had to put these together myself and I hope everybody will be forgiving if there are any mistakes in there.

                As far as privacy goes I have specifically attempted to be as privacy friendly as possible. This is for the
                simple reason that I think WWII taught us that the government and all the big companies don't need to know
                about our faith. Of course that doesn't mean we should hide in a dark corner and not speak openly about our
                faith, but it does mean that additional care is warranted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only 'pain point' right now is that I <em>am</em> using Google Analytics. This is for the simple reason
                that setting up a good privacy friendly alternative is a lot of trouble, but I did set up Google Analytics
                to respect DNT headers for those who are concerned with these kind of things.

                Just like how I believe that the Bible and Bible translations are supposed to be freely available, in the same way I believe that we as Christians should share our knowledge freely with each other. As we Christians do have a terrible history of fighting and putting words in each others mouths I did decide however to pick the NoDerivatives version which doesn't allow you to adapt these works. Realistically however if you want to remix some answers for a Bible study I sincerely believe that nobody will complain at all.

                Do note, although the content is not released under a non-NoDerivatives CC license, the ToS is set up in a way where derivatives can be created within the site and the newly created content will then indeed be published under the previously mentioned CC license. Practically this means that the NoDerivatives clause is somewhat 'useless', with the big difference that derivatives can in this way be very clearly tracked within the site (through the history button which accompanies every post).

              This application relies greatly on the freely available Lexham English Bible for which my thanks goes to Logos Bible Software. A lot of bible translations have extremely restricted licenses making distribution of the bible either illegal or extremely hard. If you are interested in reading more about this I would suggest the following <a href="http://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/16377/what-major-translations-of-the-bible-are-in-the-public-domain-and-therefore-not" target="_blank">page</a>.

              <p>You can give away the Lexham English Bible, but you can't sell it on its own. If the LEB comprises less than 25% of the content of a larger work, you can sell it as part of that work.</p>
              <p>If you give away the LEB for use with a commercial product, or sell a work containing more than 1,000 verses from the LEB, you must annually report the number of units sold, distributed, and/or downloaded.</p>
              <p>You must always attribute quotations of the LEB.</p>
              <p>If you quote less than 100 verses of the LEB in a single work you can attribute it by simply adding (LEB) after the quotation. Longer quotations, or use of 100 or more verses in a single work, must be accompanied by the following statement:</p>
              <p style="margin:20px;font-style:italic;">Scripture quotations marked (LEB) are from the Lexham English Bible. Copyright 2012 Logos Bible Software. Lexham is a registered trademark of Logos Bible Software.</p>
              <p>In electronic use, link "LEB" and "Lexham English Bible" to <a href="http://lexhamenglishbible.com" target="_blank">http://lexhamenglishbible.com</a>, and "Logos Bible Software" to <a href="http://logos.com" target="_blank">http://logos.com</a>. If all quotations are unmarked and from the LEB, you may remove "marked (LEB) are" from the statement.</p>
              <p>In support of non-English Bible translation, non-profit organizations may use 50% as the maximum portion the LEB may comprise of a work offered for sale. (This specifically allows the creation and commercial sale of diglot Bibles.)</p>
