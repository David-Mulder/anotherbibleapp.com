          This application relies greatly on the freely available Lexham English Bible for which my thanks goes to Logos Bible Software. A lot of bible translations have extremely restricted licenses making distribution of the bible either illegal or extremely hard. If you are interested in reading more about this I would suggest the following <a href="http://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/16377/what-major-translations-of-the-bible-are-in-the-public-domain-and-therefore-not" target="_blank">page</a>.

          <p>You can give away the Lexham English Bible, but you can't sell it on its own. If the LEB comprises less than 25% of the content of a larger work, you can sell it as part of that work.</p>
          <p>If you give away the LEB for use with a commercial product, or sell a work containing more than 1,000 verses from the LEB, you must annually report the number of units sold, distributed, and/or downloaded.</p>
          <p>You must always attribute quotations of the LEB.</p>
          <p>If you quote less than 100 verses of the LEB in a single work you can attribute it by simply adding (LEB) after the quotation. Longer quotations, or use of 100 or more verses in a single work, must be accompanied by the following statement:</p>
          <p style="margin:20px;font-style:italic;">Scripture quotations marked (LEB) are from the Lexham English Bible. Copyright 2012 Logos Bible Software. Lexham is a registered trademark of Logos Bible Software.</p>
          <p>In electronic use, link "LEB" and "Lexham English Bible" to <a href="http://lexhamenglishbible.com" target="_blank">http://lexhamenglishbible.com</a>, and "Logos Bible Software" to <a href="http://logos.com" target="_blank">http://logos.com</a>. If all quotations are unmarked and from the LEB, you may remove "marked (LEB) are" from the statement.</p>
          <p>In support of non-English Bible translation, non-profit organizations may use 50% as the maximum portion the LEB may comprise of a work offered for sale. (This specifically allows the creation and commercial sale of diglot Bibles.)</p>
