                Everyone is allowed to improve each others posts. The strict rule is that this may only be used within the
                boundaries of the original author's intent. So the large majority of edits will only improve spelling,
                improve formatting or remove superfluous text (like salutations and thanks). If a post was edited in a way
                that breaks with your intent as an author, then you should feel more than free to revert the changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                One type of edit that might be controversial is edits that attempt to make questions on topic. Questions
                should be specific (only a single question per question) and focused (they can't mix application and
                historical context). In those cases the author still holds the right to revert the changes, but this may
                result in the deletion of the post.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the future if/once this site ever reaches the point where this collaborative nature of becomes an issue,
                additional requirements - such as a certain number of posts with a certain number of votes - will be introduced
                before (free) editing of posts is allowed.

                Administrators hold the right to delete questions they deem off topic. Questions may be considered off topic
                because they are too broad or <a href="/help/how-to-ask">for various other reasons</a>. For the moment all
                administrators will be picked  from users who have experience with the StackExchange platform. In principle the deletion/closure rules will be based on that platform, so if your question got deleted/closed and you're confused why it might
                be a good idea to check out the StackExchange documentation.

                Unlike most other Q&A sites this site is intended to not answer individual questions people <em>had</em>, but
                rather become a repository of all questions people might <em>have</em>. So answering your own question
                is just a way to contribute to this library of knowledge.

                The Bible is a compilation of many shorter books written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the biblical canon. The original manuscripts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers. The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by William Whittingham. The goal of these was to allow referencing specific texts, which was super useful, but the necessity for these to be visible whilst reading the text has disappeared.

            <div class="card-content">
              <p>
                The recently read books list is only 'active' if you either open a book or letter without specifically
                referencing a single verse. The reason for this is that if you're for example reading through Genesis from
                start to end you don't want to lose your position just because you opened Genesis 1 again during a sermon.

                Incoming controversial statement warning! In 3! 2! 1! I sincerely think that looking for differences between
                translations is often more distracting from than helping helping with the comprehension of the text. Now, I
                definitely <stong>do</stong> think there is a place for comparing translations and grabbing an interlinear bible and studying
                the greek text, but it's a very small minority of texts where this makes an actual difference. In the cases
                where it does become relevant I hope for the Q&A system to fill in these gaps, rather than all of us who don't
                have a deep understanding of Greek and Hebrew jumping to conclusions.

                For those cases that you do need those more traditional tools I have included an 'open with' button
                (<iron-icon icon="launch"></iron-icon>) in the study tools drawer which allows you to open the verse in various
                applications. Miss an application that provides unique tooling? Contact me and I will probably add it.

              <p>
                I would absolutely love to! There are two big 'but's though, first of all there is the issue that modern
                Bible translations are nearly always under strict (possibly commercially motivated) copyright restrictions.
                Despite the fact that a lot of Bible translations are made by non profit Bible organizations they often
                have strict licensing rules along the lines of a maximum of 100 verses and at most 50% of a single book
                or letter. Ironically one of the most commercially motivated Bible-related companies in the world:
                Faithlife Corporation (Logos Bible Software), has invested in the creation of a modern and far more open
                Bible translation. Point in case: if there are other non-English bible translations like that out there of
                high quality and under a license that allows non-commercial distribution I will at least seriously consider
                adding it.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I said before there are two 'but's, the second being more technical. Although a Bible translation may
                look like a simple text file to you, in reality there is a lot of meta data to convey semantics. Adding
                more translations in a manageable way would require parsing the new Bible translation and generating the
                exact same format. Possible? Definitely, but how easy or hard it is will depend entirely on how neatly
                that meta data is encoded.
