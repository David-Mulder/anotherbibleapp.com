<book id="1 Ki"> <chapter id="1 Ki 1"> <pericope>David’s Last Days</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:1">Now King David had become old, <im>advanced in years</im>,<n><io>Literally “he went in the days”</io></n> and they covered him with garments, but he was not warm. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:2">His servants said to him, “Let them search for a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her stand before the king. Let her be of use for him, and let her lie in your lap that my lord the king may be warm.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:3">So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the territory of Israel, and they found Abishag the Shunnamite and brought her to the king. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:4">Now the young woman was very beautiful; she was of use for the king, and she served him, but the king did not <im>have sexual relations with her</im>.<n><io>Literally “know her”</io></n> </vn></pa>  <pericope>Adonijah Seeks David’s Throne</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:5">Now Adonijah the son of Haggith was exalting himself, saying, “I will be king,” so he prepared for himself a chariot and horsemen and fifty men running before him. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:6">His father did not rebuke him <im>at any time</im><n><io>Literally “from his days”</io></n> <sd>by</sd> saying, “Why did you do so?” Now he was also very handsome of appearance; she had borne him after Absalom.<n><io>“She” refers to Haggith bearing Adonijah; Absalom’s mother was Maacah</io></n> </vn><im><vn id="1 Ki 1:7">He conferred</vn></im><n><io>Literally “And there were his words”</io></n><vn id="1 Ki 1:7"> with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and <im>they supported Adonijah</im>.<n><io>Literally “they helped after Adonijah”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:8">But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty warriors were David’s; they were not with Adonijah. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:9">And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened animals near the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel. He invited all of his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:10">But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty warriors or Solomon his brother. </vn></pa>  <pericope>Solomon’s Intercessors</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:11">Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, but our lord David does not know? </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:12">So then, come, let me advise you please, <im>that you may save</im><n><io>Literally “and save”</io></n> your life and the life of your son, Solomon. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:13">Come, go to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord the king, sworn to your servant, “Surely Solomon your son shall become king after me. And he will sit on my throne”? But why is Adonijah king?’ </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:14">While you are still there speaking with the king, I will enter after you, and <im>I will confirm your words</im>.”<n><io>Literally “I will make full your words”</io></n> </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:15">So Bathsheba went to the king in the private room. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunnamite was attending the king. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:16">Bathsheba knelt and bowed down before the king, and the king asked, “<im>What do you want</im>?”<n><io>Literally “What <sd>is</sd> for you”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:17">She said to him, “My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your servant, ‘Solomon your son surely shall become king after me, and he will sit upon my throne!’ </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:18">But now, look! Adonijah has become king! And now, my lord the king, you do not know! </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:19">He has sacrificed oxen and sheep and fattened animals <im>in abundance</im>,<n><io>Literally “as far as the many”</io></n> and he has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he did not invite. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:20">But as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all of Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:21">It shall be that when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors,<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> I and my son Solomon will be <sd>considered as</sd> sinners.” </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:22">While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came <sd>in</sd>. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:23">They told the king, “Nathan the prophet is here.” He came into the presence of the king and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:24">Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne’? </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:25">“For he went down today and sacrificed oxen, sheep, and fattened animals <im>in abundance</im>.<n><io>Literally “as far as the many”</io></n> He invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and look, they are eating and drinking before him. They have also said, “Long live King Adonijah! </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:26">But me, your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon your servant he did not invite. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:27">If it was from my lord the king that this thing has happened, <sd>then all is well,</sd> but if not, you must let your servants know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:28">Then King David answered and said, “Summon Bathsheba for me.” Then she came before the king and stood in his presence.<n><io>Following the corrected LXX and Vulgate</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:29">Then the king swore and said, “<im>As Yahweh lives</im>,<n><io>Literally “The life of Yahweh”</io></n> who has saved my life from all trouble, </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:30">surely as I swore to you by Yahweh the God of Israel, saying, ‘Solomon your son shall surely be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ surely I shall do so this <sd>very</sd> day.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:31">Then Bathsheba knelt with her face to the ground and did obeisance to the king, and she said, “May my lord, King David, live forever.” </vn></pa>  <pericope>Solomon Is Crowned King</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:32">Then King David said, “Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,” and they came before the king. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:33">The king said to them, “Take with you all the servants of your lord, and let them make Solomon my son ride on my mule, and bring him down to Gihon. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:34">Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Blow on the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:35">Then you shall go up after him, and let him come and sit on my throne; he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be leader over Israel and Judah.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:36">Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! So may Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, confirm it! </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:37">As Yahweh was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:38">Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites went down, and they let Solomon ride on the mule of King David, and they brought him to Gihon. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:39">Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent, and he anointed Solomon. They blew on the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:40">All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on the flutes and rejoicing <sd>with</sd> great joy, and the earth shook with their noise. </vn></pa>  <pericope>Adonijah’s Response to the Coronation of Solomon</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:41">And Adonijah and all the invited guests who were with him heard <sd>it</sd>. Now they were finished eating when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet and said, “Why is there such a noise in the city?”<n><io>Literally “Why is the sound of the city noisy?”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:42">While he was still speaking, suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Adonijah said, “Come, for you are a man of valor, and you bring good news.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:43">Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “But our lord King David has made Solomon king! </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:44">He sent Zadok the priest with the king, and Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites; they made him ride on the king’s mule. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:45">Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing. The city has gone wild; this <sd>is</sd> the sound which you heard. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:46">And also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom! </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:47">The servants of the king also came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘Your God has made the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!’ So the king worshiped on the bed. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:48">What is more, the king said, ‘May Yahweh the God of Israel be blessed, who has given this day one sitting on my throne, and my eyes are seeing <sd>it</sd>!’ ” </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 1:49">Then all the invited guests who <sd>were</sd> for Adonijah trembled and got up and went, each on his way. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:50">Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon, and he got up and went and grasped the horns of the altar. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:51">Solomon was told, “Look, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, and he has grasped the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me <im>first</im><n><io>Literally “as the day”</io></n> that he will surely not kill his servant with the sword!’ ” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:52">Solomon said, “If he is a son of noble character, not a hair of his <sd>head</sd> will fall to the ground, but if evil is found in him, then he will die.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 1:53">Then King Solomon sent and brought him down from upon the altar. He came and did obeisance to King Solomon. Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.” </vn></pa> </chapter> <chapter id="1 Ki 2"> <pericope>David’s Instructions for Solomon</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:1">The days of David came near <sd>for him</sd> to die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying, </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:2">“I <sd>am about to</sd> go the way of all the world. Be strong and be <im>courageous</im>.<n><io>Literally “as a man”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:3">You shall keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his judgments, and his testimonies, as are written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and everywhere you turn, </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:4">so that Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons take heed of their way, to walk before me in faithfulness, with all their heart and with all their soul, no man of yours will be cut off from the throne of Israel.’ ” </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:5">“Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me when he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Jether, and he murdered them and put the blood of war in <sd>a time of</sd> peace. He put the blood of war on the leather belt that was on his waist and on the sandals which were on his feet. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:6">You must act according to your wisdom, but you must not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:7">Regarding the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, you shall do loyal love and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:8">And look, Shimei the son of Gera the son of the Benjaminite from Bahurim is with you. Now he <im>cursed me severely</im><n><io>Literally “cursed me <sd>with</sd> a curse”</io></n> when I went to Mahanaim, but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, so I swore to him by Yahweh, ‘I surely will not kill you with the sword.’ </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:9">So then, do not leave him unpunished, for you <sd>are</sd> a wise man, and you will know what you must do to him. You must bring his grey hair down to Sheol with blood.” </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:10">Then David slept with his ancestors<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> and was buried in the city of David. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:11">The days that David reigned over Israel <sd>were</sd> forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:12">Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established. </vn></pa>  <pericope>Adonijah’s Persistence</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:13">Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she said, “<im>Are you coming in peace</im>?”<n><io>Literally “<sd>Is</sd> peace your coming?”</io></n> He said, “Peace.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:14">Then he said, “<im>May I have a word with you</im>?”<n><io>Literally “A word is for me to you”</io></n> Then she said, “Go on.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:15">He said, “You know that the kingship was mine and that all Israel had set their face toward me as king, but the kingship turned around and became my brother’s, for it was from Yahweh for him <sd>to have it</sd>. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:16">Now one request I am asking from you, and you must <im>not refuse me</im>.”<n><io>Literally “not turn my face”</io></n> Then she said to him, “Go on.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:17">He said, “Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, so that he will give to me Abishag the Shunnamite as wife.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:18">Then Bathsheba said, “Very well, I will speak to the king concerning you.” </vn></pa>  <pericope>Solomon’s Responses to Adonijah, Joab, and Shimei</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:19">Bathsheba came to King Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah, and the king got up to meet her, bowed down to her, and then sat on his throne. Then he set up a throne for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:20">She said, “I have one small request I am asking from you. Do <im>not refuse me</im>.”<n><io>Literally “not turn my face”</io></n> The king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will <im>not refuse you</im>.”<n><io>Literally “not turn your face”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:21">Then she said, “Let Abishag the Shunnamite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:22">King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Why are you asking Abishag the Shunnamite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom, for he is my brother, older than I; and <sd>ask</sd> for him also Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:23">Then King Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, “Thus may God do to me and thus may he add, if Adonijah hasn’t spoken this thing at the expense of his life. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:24">So then, <im>as Yahweh lives</im>,<n><io>Literally “the life of Yahweh”</io></n> who has established me and seated me on the throne of my father David and who has established for me a dynasty as he promised, then surely Adonijah will be put to death today.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:25">King Solomon sent through the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, so he struck him, and he died. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:26">To Abiathar the priest, the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your field, for <im>you deserve to die</im>,<n><io>Literally “you are a man of death”</io></n> but on this day I will not kill you, for you carried the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you endured hardship in all the hardship that my father endured.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:27">So Solomon banished Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, thus fulfilling the word which Yahweh had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:28">When the message came to Joab (now Joab <im>had supported</im><n><io>Literally “had turned after”</io></n> Adonijah but <im>had not supported</im><n><io>Literally “had not turned after”</io></n> Absalom), he fled to the tent of Yahweh and grasped the horns of the altar. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:29">It was told to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Yahweh and was beside the altar. So Solomon sent <sd>word</sd> to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go and fall upon him.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:30">So Benaiah went to the tent of Yahweh, and he said to him, “Thus says the king: ‘Come out.’ ” And he said, “No, for I want to die here.” So Benaiah returned a word to the king, saying, “Thus Joab spoke, and thus he answered me.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:31">Then the king said to him, “Do as he spoke; fall upon him and bury him, and so you shall remove the innocent blood that Joab shed from on me and from on the house of my father. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:32">Yahweh will return his blood on his head, because he fell upon two men, more righteous and better than he, and he killed them with the sword, even though my father did not know it; <sd>namely</sd> Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:33">And their blood will return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever, but for David and his descendants and for his house and his throne, <sd>there</sd> will be peace forever from Yahweh.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:34">So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, and he fell on him and killed him, and he was buried in his house in the wilderness. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:35">Then the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:36">Then the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but you must not go out <im>anywhere whatsoever</im><n><io>Literally “where and where”</io></n> from there. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:37">It shall happen that on the day you go out and cross over the Wadi<n><io>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</io></n> Kidron, know for certain that <im>you will surely die</im>.<n><io>Literally “dying you will die”</io></n> Your blood will be on your head.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:38">Shimei said to the king, “The word is good that my lord the king has spoken to me; thus will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 2:39">It happened that at the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves fled to Achish, son of Maacah, the king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Your slaves <sd>are</sd> here in Gath.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:40">So Shimei got up and saddled his donkey, and he went to Gath, to Achish, to search for his slaves. So Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:41">When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:42">the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, “Did I not make you swear by Yahweh? I warned you, saying, ‘On the day you go out and you go <im>anywhere whatsoever</im>,<n><io>Literally “where and where”</io></n> know for certain that <im>you will surely die</im>.’<n><io>Literally “dying you will die”</io></n> And you said to me, ‘The word is good; I accept.’ </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:43">Why have you not kept the oath of Yahweh and the command which I commanded you?” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:44">Then the king said to Shimei, “You know all the evil which your heart knows, what you did to David my father. Now Yahweh will return the evil on your head, </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:45">but King Solomon will be blessed and the throne of David will be established before Yahweh forever.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 2:46">Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. </vn></pa> </chapter> <chapter id="1 Ki 3"> <pericope>Solomon’s Walk with Yahweh</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 3:1">Solomon intermarried with Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he took the daughter of Pharaoh and brought her to the city of David until he finished building his house, the house of Yahweh, and the walls of Jerusalem all around. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:2">But the people <sd>were</sd> sacrificing on the high places, for the house for the name of Yahweh had not <sd>yet</sd> been built in those days. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:3">Solomon loved Yahweh, by walking in the statutes of David his father; only he <sd>was</sd> sacrificing and offering incense on the high places. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:4">So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice, for the great high place <sd>was</sd> there. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. </vn></pa>  <pericope>Solomon’s Request for Wisdom</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 3:5">Yahweh appeared to Solomon at Gibeon in a dream at night, and God said, “Ask what I should give to you.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:6">Then Solomon said, “You have shown great loyal love with your servant David my father, as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with you. You have shown for him this great loyal love, and you have given a son to him who is sitting on his throne as <sd>it is</sd> this day. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:7">So then, O Yahweh, you are my God. You have made your servant king in place of David my father <sd>though</sd> I <sd>am</sd> a young boy. I do not know going out or coming in. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:8">Your servant <sd>is</sd> in the middle of your people whom you have chosen; a great people who cannot be counted or numbered because of abundance. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:9">Give to your servant a listening heart to judge your people, to discern between good and bad, because who is able to judge this, your difficult people?” </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 3:10">The word was good in the eyes of <sd>the</sd> Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:11">And God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing and you did not ask for yourself <im>a long life</im><n><io>Literally “many days”</io></n> and you did not ask riches for yourself and you did not ask for the life of your enemies, but you have asked for yourself <im>the ability to make wise judgments</im>;<n><io>Literally “understanding to hear judgment”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:12">behold, I do hereby do according to your word. I hereby give you a wise and discerning heart; there was no one like you before you, nor afterwards will one like you arise. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:13">Too, what you have not asked I give to you: both riches and honor, <sd>so that</sd> no man among the kings will be like you all of your days. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:14">If you will walk in my ways by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David your father walked, then I will lengthen your days.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:15">Then Solomon awoke, and look, <sd>it was</sd> a dream, and he came <sd>to</sd> Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of <sd>the</sd> Lord, and he offered burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings, and he held a feast for all of his servants. </vn></pa>  <pericope>Solomon’s Wisdom Tested: The Two Prostitutes</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 3:16">Then two prostitutes came to the king, and they stood before him. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:17">The one woman said, “Please my lord, I and this woman are living in one house, and I gave birth, with her in the house. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:18">It happened on the third day <sd>after</sd> my giving birth, this woman also gave birth, and we <sd>were</sd> together. There was not anyone with us in the house, only the two of us <sd>were</sd> in the house. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:19">Then the son of this woman died <sd>in the</sd> night because she laid on him. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:20">So she got up in the middle of the night, and she took my son from beside me while your servant was asleep, and she put him in her lap, and she put her dead son in my lap. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 3:21">When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead!

He repaired the altar of Yahweh <sd>that had been</sd> destroyed. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:31">Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of God came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:32">With them, he built an altar in the name of Yahweh, and he made a trench <im>which would have held</im><n><io>Literally “as the house of”</io></n> about two seahs of seed, all around the altar. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:33">And he arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces, and placed <sd>it</sd> on the wood.<n><io>in the Hebrew Bible, <ci title="BibleLEB2: 1 Ki 18:34">1 Kings 18:34 </ci>begins here</io></n> Then he said, “Fill four jars <sd>with</sd> water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:34">He said, “Do <sd>it</sd> again!” They did <sd>it</sd> again. He said, “Do <sd>it</sd> a third time!” So they did <sd>it</sd> a third time. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:35">The water went all around the altar, and the trench also was filled <sd>with</sd> water. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 18:36">It happened at the offering of the <sd>evening</sd> oblation, Elijah the prophet went near, and he said, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; let it be known today that you <sd>are</sd> God in Israel and <sd>that</sd> I <sd>am</sd> your servant and <sd>that</sd> I have done all of these things by your words. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:37">Answer me, O Yahweh, answer me; that this people may know that you, O Yahweh, <sd>are</sd> God and that you have turned their hearts back again.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:38">Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and it consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust; and the water which <sd>was</sd> in the trench it licked up! </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:39">When all the people saw, they fell on their faces and said, “Yahweh, he <sd>is</sd> God! Yahweh, he <sd>is</sd> God!” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:40">Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; don’t let any man of them escape!” So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the wadi<n><io>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</io></n> of Kishon and killed them there. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 18:41">Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for <sd>there is</sd> the sound of the noise of rain.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:42">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink while Elijah went to the top of Carmel, bent down to the earth, and put his face between his knees. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:43">Then he said to his servant, “Please go <sd>and</sd> look in the direction of <sd>the</sd> sea.” So he went up and looked; then he said, “There is nothing.” Then he said, “Go back,” seven times. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 18:44">It happened that at the seventh time, he said, “Look, there is a small cloud, as <sd>the</sd> hand of a man, coming up from the sea.” Then <sd>Elijah</sd> said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Harness <sd>your horses</sd> and go down, lest the rain stop you.’ ” </vn><im><vn id="1 Ki 18:45">In no time</vn></im><n><io>Literally “Until here and until here”</io></n><vn id="1 Ki 18:45"> the heavens grew black <sd>with</sd> clouds and wind, and there was heavy rain.

All the desire of your eyes <im>they will lay hands on</im><n><io>Literally “they will put in their hands”</io></n> and take it away.’ ” </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:7">Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, “Please know and realize that this <sd>man is</sd> seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my women, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not withhold <sd>anything</sd> from him.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:8">All of the elders and all of the people said to him, “Do not listen and do not consent.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:9">So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Say to my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded from your servant at the first, I will do, but this thing I am not able to do.’ ” Then the messengers went and <im>made a report to him</im>.<n><io>Literally “returned him a word”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:10">Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, “Thus may the gods do to me and thus may they add if the dust of Samaria is sufficient for the hollow of a hand for all of the people who are at my feet.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:11">The king of Israel answered and said, “Tell <sd>him</sd>, ‘Let not him who girds on his armor boast as one who takes off his armor.’ ” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:12">It happened at the moment he heard this word, he and the kings <sd>were</sd> drinking in the <im>tents</im>.<n><io>Literally “booths”</io></n> He said to his servants, “Get ready <sd>to attack</sd>.” So they got ready <sd>to attack</sd> the city. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:13">Suddenly a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Have you seen all this great crowd? Behold, I <sd>am</sd> giving it into your hand today, that you may know that I <sd>am</sd> Yahweh.’ ” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:14">Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘By the servants of the commanders of the provinces.’ ” He asked, “Who will begin the battle?” And he said, “You.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:15">So he mustered the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two. After them he mustered all of the army, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:16">They went out at noon while Ben-Hadad <sd>was</sd> drinking <sd>himself</sd> drunk in the tents, he and the thirty-two kings helping him. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:17">Then the servants of the commanders of the provinces went out first, and Ben-Hadad sent, and they reported to him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:18">Then he said, “If they have come out for peace, seize them alive; and if they have come out for war, seize them alive.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:19">But these had come out from the city, the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and the army that <sd>was</sd> after them. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:20">Each man killed his man, and the Arameans fled, so Israel pursued them, but Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with cavalry. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:21">The king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and the chariots and defeated Aram with a great blow. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:22">Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and he said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself; <im>consider well</im><n><io>Literally “know and see”</io></n> what you should do, for the king of Aram is coming against you at the turn of the year.” </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:23">The servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods <sd>are</sd> gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we.<n><io>Hebrew “he”</io></n> Let us fight with them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:24">Do this thing: remove the kings each from his post, and put a governor in their place. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:25">You must muster an army for yourself as the army <im>you have lost</im>,<n><io>Literally “as the army which fell from with you”</io></n> and horses and chariots as the horses and chariots <sd>you lost</sd>, then we will fight them in the plain. Surely we will be stronger than they.” So he listened to their voice and did so. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:26">It happened at the turning of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered Aram and went up to Aphek for the war with Israel. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:27">The <im>Israelites</im><n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> had been mustered and provisioned, and they went to engage them. The <im>Israelites</im><n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> encamped opposite them as two flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the land. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:28">Then the man of God approached, and he spoke to the king of Israel, and he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because Aram has said, “Yahweh <sd>is</sd> a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys,” ’ I will give all this great crowd into your hand that you may know that I <sd>am</sd> Yahweh.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:29">These encamped opposite for seven days, and it happened on the seventh day that <im>the battle began</im>,<n><io>Literally “the battle drew near”</io></n> and the <im>Israelites</im><n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> killed the Arameans, one hundred thousand infantry in one day. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:30">Then those who remained fled to Aphek, to the city, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who had remained, so Ben-Hadad fled and went to the innermost rooms of the city. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:31">Then his servants said to him, “Please now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kings of mercy. Let us now put sackcloth on around our waists and ropes on our heads. Then let us go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps <im>he will let you live</im>.”<n><io>Literally “he may let your life live”</io></n> </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:32">So they tied sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads. Then they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ” And he said, “<sd>Is</sd> my brother still alive?” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:33">The men took this as a good omen and they quickly accepted <sd>it</sd> as true from him, and they said, “Your brother Ben-Hadad <sd>lives</sd>.” So he said, “Go, get him.” Ben-Hadad came out to him, and <sd>Ahab</sd> pulled him up on the chariot. </vn><sd><vn id="1 Ki 20:34">Ben-Hadad</vn></sd><vn id="1 Ki 20:34"> said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I shall return. You may set up streets with stalls for yourself in Damascus just as my father set up in Samaria.” <sd>Then Ahab said</sd>, “<im>On these terms</im><n><io>Literally “In covenant”</io></n> I will let you go,” So he made a covenant with him and let him go. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:35">A certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his fellow countryman, “By the word of Yahweh, please strike me.” But the man refused to strike him. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 20:36">He said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, look, as you now are going from me, a lion will kill you.” When he went from beside him, the lion found him and killed him. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:37">Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please,” so the man struck him sharply and wounded him. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:38">Then the prophet went and <im>waited</im><n><io>Literally “stood”</io></n> for the king along the road and disguised himself with a<n><io>Hebrew “the”</io></n> headband over his eyes. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:39">As the king <sd>was</sd> passing by, he called to the king and said, “Your servant went out in the thick of the battle, and suddenly a man turned and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man. If by any means he should be missed, it will be your life in his place, or you shall pay a talent of silver.’ </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:40">It happened that your servant <im>was busy here and there</im>,<n><io>Literally “<sd>was</sd> doing here and here”</io></n> and he <im>disappeared</im>.”<n><io>Literally “and he was not”</io></n> Then the king said to him, “Your own judgment has been determined.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:41">He quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he <sd>was</sd> from the prophets. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:42">He said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because you have let the man I devoted for destruction go from <sd>your</sd> hand, your life shall be in place of his life and your people in place of his people.’ ” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 20:43">Then the king of Israel went to his house, sullen and angry, and he came to Samaria. </vn></pa> </chapter> <chapter id="1 Ki 21"> <pericope>The Vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 21:1">It happened after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which <sd>was</sd> in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 21:2">Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard that it may be mine for a garden of vegetable plants, because it is near, beside my house, and I will give to you a better vineyard in place of it. If it is better in your eyes, I will give you the money of its price.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 21:3">Naboth said to Ahab, “Far be it from me from Yahweh that I should give the inheritance of my ancestors<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> to you.” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 21:4">Then Ahab went to his house, sullen and angry because of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him <sd>when</sd> he had said, “I will not give to you the inheritance of my ancestors.”<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> So he lay on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat <sd>any</sd> food. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Ki 21:5">Then Jezebel his wife came to him, and she said to him, “What is this, that your spirit is sullen and you are not eating food?” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 21:6">Then he said to her, “When I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and asked him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or it you prefer, I will give you a vineyard in place of it,’ he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ” </vn><vn id="1 Ki 21:7">Jezebel his wife said to him, “Now, you <im>rule</im><n><io>Literally “do kingship”</io></n> over Israel.

She sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who <sd>were</sd> dwelling with Naboth in his city. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 21:9">She had written in the letters, saying, “Call a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people. </vn><vn id="1 Ki 21:10">Seat two men, <im>scoundrels</im>,<n><io>Literally “sons of wickedness”</io></n> opposite him.
