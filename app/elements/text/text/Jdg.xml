I hereby give the land into his hand.” </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:3">And Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Go up with me into my allotment, and let us fight against the Canaanites; then I too will go with you into your allotment.” And Simeon went with him. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:4">And Judah went up, and Yahweh gave the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> and the Perizzites<n><io>Hebrew “Perizzite”</io></n> into their hand, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:5">At Bezek they came upon Adoni-bezek, and they fought against him and defeated the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> and the Perizzites.<n><io>Hebrew “Perizzite”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:6">And Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued after him; they caught him and cut off <im>his thumbs and big toes</im>.<n><io>Literally “the thumbs of his hands and feet”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:7">Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with <im>their thumbs and big toes</im><n><io>Literally “the thumbs of their hands and feet”</io></n> cut off used to pick up <sd>scraps</sd> under my table; just as I have done, so God has repaid to me. And they brought him <sd>to</sd> Jerusalem, and he died there. </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 1:8">The descendants<n><io>Or “sons/children”</io></n> of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and they captured it, <im>put it to the sword</im>,<n><io>Literally “they struck it with the mouth of the sword”</io></n> and <im>set the city on fire</im>.<n><io>Literally “the city they sent away with fire”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:9">Afterward the descendants<n><io>Or “sons/children”</io></n> of Judah pursued to fight against the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> who were living in the hill country, the Negev,<n><io>An arid region south of the Judean hills</io></n> and the Shephelah.<n><io>A geographical region associated with an area of low country on the western edge of the Judaean hills.</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:10">And Judah went against the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> living in Hebron (the former name of Hebron <sd>was</sd> Kiriath Arba). And they defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 1:11">And from there they went to the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir <sd>was</sd> Kiriath Sepher). </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:12">And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give to him Acsah my daughter as a wife.” </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:13">Othniel son of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb, captured it, and he gave to him Acsah his daughter as a wife. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:14">When she came <sd>to him</sd>, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from the donkey, Caleb said to her, “<im>What do you want</im>?”<n><io>Literally “What <sd>is</sd> for you?”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:15">And she said to him, “Give me <im>a gift</im>;<n><io>Literally “blessing”</io></n> you have given me the land of the Negev,<n><io>An arid region south of the Judaean hills</io></n> and give me also a spring of water.” And Caleb gave to her the upper and lower spring.<n><io><ci title="BibleLEB2: Jdg 1:11–15">Judges 1:11–15 </ci>is almost identical to <ci title="BibleLEB2: Jos 15:13–19">Joshua 15:13–19</ci></io></n> </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 1:16">The descendants<n><io>Or “sons/children”</io></n> of Hobab <sd>the</sd> Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the descendants<n><io>Or “sons/children”</io></n> of Judah from the city of palms <sd>into</sd> the wilderness of Judah, which <sd>is</sd> in <sd>the</sd> Negev<n><io>An arid region south of the Judaean hills</io></n> <sd>near</sd> Arad. And they went<n><io>Hebrew “he went”</io></n> and settled with the people. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:17">And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> inhabiting Zephath; they utterly destroyed it, so he called the name of the city Hormah. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:18">Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:19">And Yahweh was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they <sd>had</sd> chariots of iron. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:20">They gave Hebron to Caleb just as Moses said, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:21">But the descendants<n><io>Or “sons/children”</io></n> of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites<n><io>Hebrew “Jebusite”</io></n> who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived among the descendants<n><io>Or “sons/children”</io></n> of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 1:22">Likewise, the house of Joseph went up <sd>against</sd> Bethel, and Yahweh <sd>was</sd> with them. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:23">And the house of Joseph spied out Bethel (the former name of the city was Luz). </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:24">And when the spies saw a man leaving the city,<n><io>Or “going out from the city”</io></n> they said to him, “Please show us the entrance of the city, and we will deal kindly<n><io>Or “do a loyal love”</io></n> with you.” </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:25">So he showed them the entrance of the city, and they struck the city with <im>the edge of the sword</im>,<n><io>Literally “<sd>the</sd> mouth of <sd>the</sd> sword”</io></n> but they let go the man and all his family. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:26">And the man went <sd>to</sd> the land of the Hittites, and he built a city and named it Luz; this <sd>is</sd> its name to this day. </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 1:27">Manasseh did not drive out Beth-Sean and its towns, or Taanach and its towns, or the inhabitants<n><io>Hebrew “inhabitant”</io></n> of Dor and its towns, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> <sd>were</sd> determined to live in this land. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:28">And it happened, when Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> to forced labor, but they never totally drove them out. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:29">Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> living in Gezer, so the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> lived in their midst in Gezer. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:30">Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol, so the Canaanites<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> lived in their midst and became <sd>subjected</sd> to forced labor. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:31">Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob, </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:32">so the Asherites<n><io>Hebrew “Asherite”</io></n> lived in the midst of the Canaanites,<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out. </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 1:33">Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or Beth-anath, but lived in the midst of the Canaanites,<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> the inhabitants of the land; the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them. </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 1:34">The Amorites pressed<n><io>Or “forced”</io></n> the descendants<n><io>Or “sons/children”</io></n> of Dan to the hill country, and they did not allow them to come down to the plain; </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:35">the Amorites <sd>were</sd> determined to live in Har-heres,<n><io>Or “Mount Heres”</io></n> in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy <sd>on them</sd>, and they became <sd>subjected</sd> to forced labor. </vn><vn id="Jdg 1:36">The border of the Amorites<n><io>Hebrew “Amorite”</io></n> <sd>ran</sd> from the ascent of Akrabbim from Sela and upward. </vn></p> </chapter> <chapter id="Jdg 2"> <pericope>Israel Disobeys Yahweh</pericope> <p><vn id="Jdg 2:1">And the angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, “I brought you up from Egypt, and I brought you to the land that I had promised to your ancestors.<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:2">And <sd>as for</sd> you, do not <im>make a covenant</im><n><io>Literally “cut a covenant”</io></n> with the inhabitants of this land; break down their altars.’ But you did not listen to my voice. <im>Why would you do such a thing</im>?<n><io>Literally “What is this thing you have done?”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:3">Now I say, I will not drive them out from before you; they will <im>become as thorns</im><n><io>Or “become snares;” some ancient manuscripts read “be adversaries”</io></n> for you, and their gods will be a trap for you.” </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:4">And as the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the <im>Israelites</im>,<n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> the people <im>wept bitterly</im>.<n><io>Literally “lifted up their voices and they wept”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:5">And they called the name of this place Bokim,<n><io>“Bokim” means “weepers”</io></n> and there they sacrificed to Yahweh. </vn></p>  <pericope>Joshua Dies</pericope> <p><vn id="Jdg 2:6">And Joshua sent the people away, and the <im>Israelites</im><n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> went each to their<n><io>Hebrew “his”</io></n> own inheritance to take possession of the land. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:7">And the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who saw all the great work Yahweh had done for Israel. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:8">And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, died <im>at the age of one hundred and ten years</im>.<n><io>Literally “a son of one hundred and ten years”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:9">They buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnah-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:10">Moreover, that entire generation was gathered to their<n><io>Hebrew “his”</io></n> ancestors,<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> and another generation grew up after them who did not know Yahweh or the work he had done for Israel.<n><io><ci title="BibleLEB2: Jdg 2:6–10">Judges 2:6–10 </ci>is repeated in <ci title="BibleLEB2: Jos 24:28–31">Joshua 24:28–31</ci></io></n> </vn></p>  <pericope>Israel Worships the Baals</pericope> <p><vn id="Jdg 2:11">The <im>Israelites</im><n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and <im>they served</im><n><io>Or “they worshiped”</io></n> the Baals. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:12">They abandoned Yahweh the God of their ancestors,<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> who brought them out from the land of Egypt. They <im>followed</im><n><io>Literally “went after”</io></n> other gods from the gods of the people who <sd>were</sd> around them; and they bowed down to them, and they provoked the anger of Yahweh. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:13">They abandoned Yahweh, and they served Baal and the Ashtaroth. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:14">So <im>the anger of Yahweh was kindled</im><n><io>Literally “The nose of Yahweh became hot”</io></n> against Israel, and he gave them into the hand of plunderers; and they plundered them, and he sold them into the hand of their enemies from all sides. They were unable to withstand their enemies any longer. </vn><im><vn id="Jdg 2:15">Whenever</vn></im><n><io>Literally “At all that”</io></n><vn id="Jdg 2:15"> they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them to harm <sd>them</sd>, just as Yahweh warned, and just as Yahweh had sworn to them. And <im>they were very distressed</im>.<n><io>Literally “it was very cramped for them”</io></n> </vn></p> <p><vn id="Jdg 2:16">Then Yahweh raised up leaders,<n><io>Or “judges”</io></n> and they delivered them from the hand of their plunderers. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:17">But they did not listen to their leaders,<n><io>Or “judges”</io></n> but lusted after other gods and bowed down to them. They turned away quickly from the way that their ancestors<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> went, who had obeyed the commandment of Yahweh; they did not do <sd>as their ancestors</sd>. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:18">And when Yahweh raised leaders<n><io>Or “judges”</io></n> for them, Yahweh was with the leader,<n><io>Or “judge”</io></n> and he delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the leader,<n><io>Or “judge”</io></n> for Yahweh was moved by their groaning because of their persecutors and oppressors. </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:19">But when the leader<n><io>Or “judge”</io></n> died they relapsed and acted corruptly, more than their ancestors,<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> following other gods, serving them,<n><io>Or “worshiping them”</io></n> and bowing down to them. They would not give up their deeds or their stubborn ways. </vn><im><vn id="Jdg 2:20">So the anger of Yahweh burned</vn></im><n><io>Literally “So the nose of Yahweh became hot”</io></n><vn id="Jdg 2:20"> against Israel, and he said, “Because this people transgressed my covenant that I commanded their ancestors,<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> and have not obeyed my voice, </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:21">I will not again drive out anyone from before them from the nations that Joshua left when he died, </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:22">in order to test Israel whether or not they would observe the way of Yahweh, to walk in it just as their ancestors<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> did.” </vn><vn id="Jdg 2:23">So Yahweh left those nations; he did not drive them out at once, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua. </vn></p> </chapter> <chapter id="Jdg 3"> <pericope>Some Nations Remain in the Land</pericope> <p><vn id="Jdg 3:1">These <sd>are</sd> the nations that Yahweh left, to test Israel by them (<sd>that is, to test</sd> all those who <im>had not experienced</im><n><io>Literally “did not know”</io></n> any of the wars of Canaan, </vn><vn id="Jdg 3:2">in order that the generations of Israel would know war, to teach those <im>who had not experienced it</im><n><io>Literally “who had not known it”</io></n> before): </vn><vn id="Jdg 3:3">the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites,<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> the Sidonians,<n><io>Hebrew “Sidonian”</io></n> and the Hivites<n><io>Hebrew “Hivite”</io></n> living on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon up to Lebo-Hamath. </vn><vn id="Jdg 3:4">They were <sd>left</sd> for testing Israel, to know <sd>whether</sd> they would keep the commands of Yahweh that he commanded their ancestors<n><io>Or “fathers”</io></n> through the hand of Moses. </vn><vn id="Jdg 3:5">And the <im>Israelites</im><n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> lived in the midst of the Canaanites,<n><io>Hebrew “Canaanite”</io></n> the Hittites,<n><io>Hebrew “Hittite”</io></n> the Amorites,<n><io>Hebrew “Amorite”</io></n> the Perizzites,<n><io>Hebrew “Perizzite”</io></n> the Hivites,<n><io>Hebrew “Hivite”</io></n> and the Jebusites.<n><io>Hebrew “Jebusite”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Jdg 3:6">And they took their daughters as wives for themselves, and they gave their daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.<n><io>Or “worshiped their gods”</io></n> </vn></p>  <pericope>Othniel</pericope> <p><vn id="Jdg 3:7">The <im>Israelites</im><n><io>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</io></n> did evil in the eyes of Yahweh.
