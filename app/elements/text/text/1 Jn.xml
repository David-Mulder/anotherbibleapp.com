We know that whenever he is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is. </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:3">And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that one is pure. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="1 Jn 3:4">Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:5">And you know that that one was revealed in order that he might take away sins, and in him <sd>there</sd> is no sin. </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:6">Everyone who resides in him does not sin. Everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him. </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:7">Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous. </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:8">The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this <sd>reason</sd> the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the works of the devil. </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:9">Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin, because his seed resides in him, and <sd>he is</sd> not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:10">By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, namely, the one who does not love his brother. </vn></pa>  <pericope>God is Love, so Love One Another</pericope> <pa><vn id="1 Jn 3:11">For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another, </vn><vn id="1 Jn 3:12">not as Cain, who was of the evil one and violently murdered his brother.
