</vn><vn id="Ga 1:20">(Now <sd>the things</sd> which I am writing to you, behold, <sd>I assure you</sd> before God that I am not lying.) </vn><vn id="Ga 1:21">Then I came to the regions of Syria and

hearing, “The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy,” </vn><vn id="Ga 1:24">and they were glorifying God because of me. </vn></pa> </chapter> <chapter id="Ga 2"> <pericope>Paul’s Ministry Recognized by the Jerusalem Apostles</pericope> <pa><vn id="Ga 2:1"> Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus also. </vn><vn id="Ga 2:2">Now I went up <sd>there</sd> because of a revelation and laid out to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but in private to the influential people, lest somehow I was running, or had run, in vain. </vn><vn id="Ga 2:3">But not even Titus <sd>who was</sd> with me, <sd>although</sd><n tag="NFP"><io> *Here “<sd>although</sd>” is supplied as a

secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they might enslave us, </vn><vn id="Ga 2:5">to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain continually with you. </vn><vn id="Ga 2:6">But from those <im>who were influential</im><n><io>Literally “who were thought to be

Barnabas was carried away with them in <sd>their</sd> hypocrisy. </vn><vn id="Ga 2:14">But when I saw that they were not being straightforward with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of <sd>them</sd> all, “If you, <sd>although you</sd><n tag="NFP"><io> *Here “<sd>although</sd>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“are”) which is understood as concessive</io></n> are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?” </vn></pa>  <pericope>Justified by Faith in Christ</pericope> <pa><vn id="Ga 2:15">We

“by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ”</io></n> and we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by faith in Christ<n><io>Or “by the faithfulness of Christ”</io></n> and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law <im>no human being will be justified</im><n><io>Literally “all flesh will not be justified”</io></n>. </vn><vn id="Ga 2:17">But if <sd>while</sd> seeking to be justified by Christ, <sd>we</sd> ourselves also have been found <sd>to be</sd> sinners, then <sd>is</sd> Christ an agent of sin? May it never be! </vn><vn id="Ga 2:18">For if I build up again these <sd>things</sd> which I destroyed, I show myself <sd>to be</sd> a transgressor. </vn><vn id="Ga 2:19">For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, </vn><vn id="Ga 2:20">and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and that <sd>life</sd> I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. </vn><vn id="Ga 2:21">I do not declare invalid the grace of God, for if righteousness <sd>is</sd> through the law, then Christ died to no purpose. </vn></pa> </chapter> <chapter id="Ga 3"> <pericope>Justified by the Law, or Justified by Faith?</pericope> <pa><vn id="Ga 3:1"> O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed <sd>as</sd> having been crucified? </vn><vn id="Ga 3:2">I want only to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? </vn><vn id="Ga 3:3">Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to be made complete by the flesh? </vn><vn id="Ga 3:4">Have you suffered so many <sd>things</sd> for nothing—if indeed also <sd>it was</sd> for nothing? </vn><vn id="Ga 3:5">Therefore does the one who gives you the Spirit and who works miracles among you <sd>do so</sd> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="Ga 3:6">Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness, </vn><vn id="Ga 3:7">then understand that the ones <im>who have faith</im><n><io>Literally “of faith”</io></n>, these are sons of Abraham. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham: “In you all the nations<n><io>Or “Gentiles”; the same Greek word can be translated “nations” or “Gentiles” depending on the context</io></n> will be blessed.”<n><io>A quotation from <ci ref="Ge 12:3">Gen 12:3</ci>; <ci ref="Ge 18:18">18:18</ci></io></n> </vn><vn id="Ga 3:9">So then, the ones <sd>who have</sd> faith are blessed together with Abraham who believed. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, “Cursed <sd>is</sd> everyone who does not abide by all <sd>the things</sd> that are written in the book of the law to do them.”<n><io>A quotation from <ci ref="Dt 27:26">Deut 27:26</ci></io></n> </vn><vn id="Ga 3:11">Now <sd>it is</sd> clear that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because “the one who is righteous will live by faith.”<n><io>Or “the one who is righteous by faith will live,” a quotation from <ci ref="Hab 2:4">Hab 2:4</ci></io></n> </vn><vn id="Ga 3:12">But the law is not from faith, but “the one who does these <sd>things</sd> will live by them.”<n><io>A quotation from <ci ref="Le 18:5">Lev 18:5</ci></io></n> </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="Ga 3:13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law <sd>by</sd><n tag="NFP"><io> *Here “<sd>by</sd>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“becoming”) which is understood as means</io></n> becoming a curse for us, because it is written, “Cursed <sd>is</sd> everyone who hangs on a tree,”<n><io>A quotation from <ci ref="Dt 21:23">Deut 21:23</ci></io></n> </vn><vn id="Ga 3:14">in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. </vn></pa>  <pericope>The Promise to Abraham and His Descendant</pericope> <pa><vn id="Ga 3:15">Brothers, I am speaking according to a human perspective. Nevertheless, <sd>when</sd><n tag="NFP"><io> *Here “<sd>when</sd>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“has been ratified”) which is understood as temporal</io></n> the covenant of a man has been ratified, no one declares <sd>it</sd> invalid or adds additional provisions <sd>to it</sd>. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:16">Now to Abraham and to his descendant the promises were spoken.

May it never be! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, certainly righteousness would have been from the law. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:22">But the scripture imprisoned all under sin, in order that the promise could be given by faith<n><io>Or “through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ”</io></n> in Jesus Christ to those who believe. </vn></pa> <pa><vn id="Ga 3:23">But before faith came, we were detained under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:24">So then, the law became our guardian until Christ, in order that we could be justified by faith. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:25">But <sd>after</sd><n tag="NFP"><io> *Here “<sd>after</sd>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“has come”) which is understood as temporal</io></n> faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:26">For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,<n><io>Or “For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith”</io></n> </vn><vn id="Ga 3:27">for as many <sd>of you</sd> as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </vn><vn id="Ga 3:29">And if you <sd>are</sd> Christ’s, then you are descendants of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. </vn></pa> </chapter> <chapter id="Ga 4"> <pericope>No Longer Slaves But Sons and Heirs</pericope> <pa><vn id="Ga 4:1"> Now I say, for as long a time <sd>as</sd> the heir is a child, <sd>he is</sd> no different from a slave, <sd>although he</sd><n tag="NFP"><io> *Here “<sd>although</sd>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“is”) which is understood as concessive</io></n> is master of everything, </vn><vn id="Ga 4:2">but he is under guardians and managers until the time set by <sd>his</sd> father. </vn><vn id="Ga 4:3">So also we, when we were children, we were enslaved under the elemental spirits of the world. </vn><vn id="Ga 4:4">But when the fullness of time came, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, </vn><vn id="Ga 4:5">in order that he might redeem those under the law, in order that we might receive the adoption. </vn><vn id="Ga 4:6">And because you are sons, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba!<n><io>“Abba” is Aramaic for “father”</io></n> (Father!),” </vn><vn id="Ga 4:7">so that you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir through God. </vn></pa>  <pericope>Do Not Be Enslaved Again</pericope> <pa><vn id="Ga 4:8">But at that time <sd>when you</sd><n tag="NFP"><io> *Here “<sd>when</sd>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“know”) which is understood as temporal</io></n> did not know God, you were enslaved to the things which by nature are not gods. </vn><vn id="Ga 4:9">But now, <sd>because you</sd> have come to know God, or rather have come to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental spirits?
