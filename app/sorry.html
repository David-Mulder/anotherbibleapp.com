      <h1>Sorry...</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there, we've never met, but I am the developer of this web application. Making web applications isn't that hard
        nowadays, but when you do it in your free time it still is quite the investment. To give you some kind of idea:
        if you printed the code I wrote for this web application <i>without all the content</i> it would right now still be a
        400+ page book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, you as a user might not think a lot about which browser you're using, but developers of websites all over the world go through a lot of troubles to make sure each website works in each browser. When you get paid to do your job that's simply what you do, but when the driving force behind a project is passion rather than money it suddenly becomes a lot
        harder to justify. <strong>The result of this is that two of the most out of date browsers in the world (Internet
        Explorer/Edge and Safari) are not supported.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Want to use this web application? Either wait till your browser catches up or use one of the following browsers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://chrome.com">Google Chrome</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://opera.com">Opera</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And there are a whole lot of other browsers I haven't checked which probably work as well.
      </p>

      <h1>The somewhat technical details</h1>
      <p>
        As a developer it's hardest to make web applications work in IE/Edge and Safari due
        to these browsers always lagging behind the other browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What's the issue with Internet Explorer?</strong> Internet Explorer has been forked and new versions are now called Edge.
        If you're on Windows 10 and you refuse switching to a totally new browser then at least switch to Edge. This
        application will never work in Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why isn't it working in Edge then?</strong> Edge is technically a pretty cool browser, however the development tools are
        terrible and when something isn't working there is often no indication at all why it's not working<sup>1</sup>. Additionally it
        also misses certain features that this web application uses, but given better developer tooling I could definitely
        fix that easily. Likely at some point in the future this web application will start working in Edge once Edge
        catches up with the other browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why isn't this working in Safari?</strong> Safari is a browser that feels great to the user, but in reality it's a browser
        that on the inside is the most out of date browser on the market. And as if that's not enough it's also a
        browser that requires a 1000 euro investment to develop for (as it's the only<sup>2</sup> browser that's not available on other
        operating systems so it requires one to buy a mac). Either way, once Safari catches up the chance is really big
        that the application will automatically start working.
      </p>
      <p>
        <small><sup>1</sup> When I was trying to make it work in Edge I even got to the point where it would
        sometimes function correctly, but I wasn't able to find the issue that makes it fail virtuall all of the time.</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small><sup>2</sup> Unlike Apple, Microsoft does provide free OS images that allow you to develop for IE/Edge on Linux/Mac.</small>
