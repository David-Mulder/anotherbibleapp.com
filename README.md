Just a dump of all the code from anotherbibleapp.com. Not yet nice and polished for outside contributions, but this allows others to take a look
at the inner workings more easily and allows me to refer people to specific parts (e.g. when asked how to set up a recaptcha element).

In case you're actually interested in the app itself, I set up a quick tech showcase over at https://anotherbibleapp.com/tech
